# ðŸ“„ Quiz App Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Quiz App** is a lightweight, interactive web application built
using **React, Vite, and TailwindCSS**.\
It allows users to attempt multiple-choice questions, receive instant
feedback, and track their scores.\
The app is designed with simplicity, responsiveness, and scalability in
mind.

## 2. Architecture

### ðŸ”¹ High-Level Flow

1.  **Question Data** (can be static JSON or fetched from an API).\
2.  **React Components** render the quiz interface.\
3.  **State Management** (React `useState` & `useEffect`) handles
    current question, score, and feedback.\
4.  **UI Layer** styled using TailwindCSS for responsiveness.\
5.  **Build & Deployment** optimized with Vite, deployed via Netlify.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ðŸ”¹ Component Breakdown

-   **`App.jsx`**
    -   Root component, manages quiz flow.\
    -   Maintains states:
        -   `currentQuestion` â†’ which question is active\
        -   `score` â†’ user's current score\
        -   `showResult` â†’ whether to display final result
-   **`Question.jsx`** (if separated)
    -   Displays a single question and its multiple-choice options.\
    -   Handles user's answer selection.
-   **`Result.jsx`** (if separated)
    -   Shows final score and summary after quiz completion.
-   **`main.jsx`**
    -   Entry point, renders `App` into the DOM.
-   **`index.css` & TailwindCSS**
    -   Provides styling, responsiveness, and utility classes.

## 3. Design Decisions

1.  **React with Vite**
    -   Chosen for fast development, hot module replacement (HMR), and
        modern JavaScript support.
2.  **TailwindCSS**
    -   Used for rapid styling with utility-first classes.\
    -   Ensures mobile responsiveness with minimal custom CSS.
3.  **State Management**
    -   Simple `useState` hooks instead of external libraries (like
        Redux) since the app's state is small and easy to handle.
4.  **Scalability**
    -   Quiz data separated from UI logic.\
    -   Easy to extend by fetching questions from an API or database in
        the future.
5.  **Deployment on Netlify**
    -   Free, fast, and directly integrates with GitHub for continuous
        deployment.

## 4. Conclusion

This Quiz App demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, modular React
components, and efficient UI with TailwindCSS.\
It serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced quiz or
e-learning applications.
