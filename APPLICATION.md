# Quiz App â€“ Architecture & Design Decisions

## ðŸ”¹ Framework & Tools
- **React + Vite** â†’ Chosen for fast bundling and modern development.  
- **TailwindCSS** â†’ Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI design.  
- **ESLint** â†’ Code linting for cleaner and more consistent code.  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Architecture
- **index.html** â†’ Entry point for the app.  
- **src/** â†’ Contains all React components and logic.  
  - `App.jsx` â€“ Main app container  
  - `components/` â€“ UI components like QuestionCard, Scoreboard, etc.  
  - `assets/` â€“ Images or icons  
- **vite.config.js** â†’ Vite configuration  
- **tailwind.config.js** â†’ Tailwind setup  

## ðŸ”¹ Design Choices
1. **Component-Based Design**  
   Each quiz element (question, options, score) is a reusable React component.  

2. **State Management**  
   - Local component state using `useState` for score, current question, and user answers.  
   - Chosen for simplicity (no Redux/Context needed for small app).  

3. **Responsiveness**  
   TailwindCSS ensures mobile-first, responsive design with minimal custom CSS.  

4. **Performance**  
   Vite ensures fast development and optimized production builds.

- Add categories & difficulty levels
